# dotconfig files by Caitlyn Stewart

Version 1.0

### Change Log

Version 1.0 - added my .xinitrc and init.vim for nvim


### Uses

I was sick of setting up nvim and xinitrc files and other .config files and decided to just have a git repo to easily push and pull the files making reinstalling easier.

### To Do 

Working on my fish config currently and it will be added when I have it how I want it.
